(1, 'Chris Evans', '1981-06-13', 'Boston, Massachusetts, USA', 'ChrisEvans.jpg', 'Christopher Robert Evans began his acting career in typical fashion: performing in school productions and community theatre.\r\n\r\nHe was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Lisa (Capuano), who worked at the Concord Youth Theatre, and G. Robert Evans III, a dentist. His uncle is congressman Mike Capuano. Chris\'s father is of half German and half Welsh/English/Scottish ancestry, while Chris\'s mother is of half Italian and half Irish descent. He has an older sister, Carly Evans, and two younger siblings, a brother named Scott Evans, who is also an actor, and a sister named Shana Evans. The family moved to suburban Sudbury when he was 11 years-old. Bitten by the acting bug in the first grade because his older sister, Carly, started performing, Evans followed suit and began appearing in school plays. While at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School, his drama teacher cited his performance as \"Leontes\" in \"The Winter\'s Tale\" as exemplary of his skill. After more plays and regional theatre, he moved to New York and attended the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute.\r\n\r\nOn the advice of friends, he landed an internship at a casting office and befriended a couple of the agents he regularly communicated with - one of whom later took him on as a client. The screen - not the stage - then became his focus; Evans soon began auditioning for feature films and television series. Evans made one of his first appearances on The Fugitive (2000) (CBS, 2000-2001), a remake of the 1960s series and feature film starring Harrison Ford. In the episode \"Guilt\", Evans played the son of a small-town sheriff who tries to exact revenge after Dr. Richard Kimble - incognito as a liquor store owner - refuses to sell him and his friends alcohol. After small roles in Cherry Falls (2000) and The Newcomers (2000) - two unknown low-budget features - Evans appeared in Boston Public (2000) (Fox, 2000-2004) as a murder suspect. He then appeared in his first major feature, Not Another Teen Movie (2001), a spoof on teen comedies wherein he played a jock who makes a bet that he can turn an unpopular and unkempt girl (Chyler Leigh) into prom queen.\r\n\r\nAfter filming a couple of television pilots he was confident would be successful - Just Married (2003) and Eastwick (2002) - he appeared in another listless teen comedy, The Perfect Score (2004), playing an average, ho-hum student who takes part in a plot to steal the SAT test. Hijinks naturally ensue. Then, Evans broke through to the Big Time, grabbing the lead in the kidnapping thriller, Cellular (2004), a suspenseful B movie with a cheesy gimmick - a random wrong number on his cell phone forces him into a high-stakes race to save an unknown woman\'s life. Despite an unassuming performance from Evans and Kim Basinger as the damsel in distress, Cellular (2004) failed to break any box office records or please a wide majority of critics. Evans then prepared himself for super stardom when he signed on to play Johnny Storm in Fantastic Four (2005), 20th Century Fox\'s long-awaited adaptation of the Marvel comic. Although the film was wildly uneven and disappointing, Evans nearly stole the show with his energetic, unfettered performance. In that year itself, Chris was noticed by critics and made it into magazine and Internet countdowns, scoring himself a third position of the hot body countdown from Gay.com and #18 on E! Television\'s 2006 101 Sexiest Celebrity Bodies.\r\n\r\nThe year 2007 also proved to be one successful year for Chris, as he had two movies released around the world that same year, starting with the second installment of the Marvel franchise Fantastic Four. Chris received positive reviews for his performance. The Nanny Diaries (2007), where Evans played Harvard Hottie, showed his sensitive. The year 2008 saw Chris Evans\' part of the movie Street Kings (2008), playing the character Detective Paul Diskant. The movie is about police officers trying to cover up their wrongdoings and audiences got to see a serious side of Chris. In the same year, Chris also worked on the movie The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond (2008).'),

(9, 'Jeremy Renner', '1971-01-07', 'Modesto, California, USA', 'jeremyRenner.jpg', 'Jeremy Lee Renner was born in Modesto, California, the son of Valerie (Tague) and Lee Renner, who managed a bowling alley. After a tumultuous yet happy childhood with his four younger siblings, Renner graduated from Beyer High School and attended Modesto Junior College. He explored several areas of study, including computer science, criminology, and psychology, before the theater department, with its freedom of emotional expression, drew him in.  However, Renner recognized the potential in acting as much through the local police academy as through drama classes. During his second year at Modesto Junior College, Renner role-played a domestic disturbance perpetrator as part of a police-training exercise for an easy $50. Deciding to shift his focus away from schoolwork, Renner left college and moved to San Francisco to study at the American Conservatory Theater. From there he moved to Hawaii and, in 1993, to Los Angeles.  In Los Angeles, Renner devoted himself to theater, most notably starring in and co-directing the critically acclaimed \"Search and Destroy.\" He pursued other projects during this time as well, landing his first film role in 1995\'s Senior Trip (1995). After several commercials and supporting roles in television movies and series, Renner captured the attention of critics with his gripping, complex portrayal of the infamous serial killer in the 2002 film Dahmer (2002). Renner\'s performance, which earned him an Independent Spirit Award nomination, is especially remarkable for painting a humane and sympathetic, yet deeply disturbing, portrait of the title character.  In 2003, Renner took a break from small indie films to work on his first commercially successful movie, S.W.A.T. (2003), with Colin Farrell. In 2005, he played the leading role in Neo Ned (2005) as an institutionalized white supremacist in love with a black girl, winning the Palm Beach International Film Festival\'s best actor award. Renner\'s pivotal supporting roles in 2005\'s 12 and Holding (2005) and North Country (2005) earned him accolades from critics, and his 2007 turn in Take (2007) garnered him the best actor award at California\'s Independent Film Festival. Also in 2007, Renner played a leading role in the horror film 28 Weeks Later (2007) as well as a supporting role in the underrated Western epic The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007), with Casey Affleck, Brad Pitt, and Sam Rockwell.  Renner\'s depiction of Jeffrey Dahmer in 2002 caught the attention of director Kathryn Bigelow, and, in 2008, she cast him in his most famous role as Sergeant First Class William James in The Hurt Locker (2008). Renner\'s performance as a single-minded bomb specialist scored him an Academy Award nomination for best actor. He also earned best actor nominations from the Independent Spirit Awards, the Screen Actors Guild, and the BAFTA Awards, as well as wins in this category from several film critics groups.  In 2009, Renner starred in the short-lived TV series, The Unusuals (2009), and in 2010 he played the chilling but loyal criminal Jem in Ben Affleck bank-heist thriller The Town (2010). In the fall of 2010, Renner began filming Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol (2011). He has also since starred in Avengers Assemble (2012), American Hustle (2013), and Kill the Messenger (2014).  Renner\'s strengths as an actor derive not only from his expressive eyes but also from his ability to thoroughly embody the characters he portrays. His visceral depiction of these individuals captivates audiences and empowers him to steal scenes in many of his films, even when playing a minor role. Renner gravitates toward flawed, complicated, three-dimensional characters that allow him to explore new territory within himself.  In addition to his work as an actor, Renner continues to cultivate his lifelong love of music. A singer, songwriter, and musician, he performed with the band Sons of Ben early in his career. Scenes in Love Comes to the Executioner (2006), North Country (2005), and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007) briefly showcase Renner\'s singing talents.  Despite traveling the world for film roles and, recently, as a United Nations Goodwill Peace Ambassador to raise awareness for mine-clearing efforts in Afghanistan, Renner remains close to his roots. In 2010, Modesto Junior College presented him the Distinguished Alumnus award in recognition of his body of work as an actor. He also headlined at a benefit for Modesto\'s Gallo Center for the Arts in the fall of 2010.  Renner maintains a sense of humility and gratitude, even in the wake of his recent successes and recognition. He keeps himself grounded by renovating and restoring old and rundown iconic Hollywood homes, an enterprise he began back in his early days in Los Angeles. He values loyalty and a sense of both age and history, and enjoys the opportunity to help conserve these qualities in a town that favors the young and the new.'),

His potential was spotted by choreographer Lynne Page (who was an Associate to Peter Darling, choreographer of Billy Elliot and Billy Elliot the Musical) when he performed with his dance school as part of the Richmond Dance Festival 2006. After eight auditions and subsequent two years of training, on 28 June 2008 Tom made his West End debut in Billy Elliot the Musical as Michael, Billy\'s best friend.

His portrayal is genuine, and at no moment does it feel melodramatic and forced. The majority of his scenes are separate from the lead actors and for the most part it feels like The Impossible is Holland\'s film\" (Entertainment Maven); \"Mr. Holland, meanwhile, matures before our eyes, navigating the passage from adolescent self-absorption to profound and terrible responsibility. He is a terrific young actor\" (New York Times).  Tom has given a number of interviews about his role in The Impossible.

The best I\'d ever seen in a kid.\" Ewan McGregor: \"It was wonderful watching Tom who had never worked in front of a camera before, to see him really get it and grow as a film actor as he went along. He\'s really talented and polite to everyone. It\'s very easy for children to lose perspective but he\'s absolutely on the right road and a brilliant actor.\" Naomi Watts: \"He has an incredible emotional instrument and an unbelievable sense of himself... Tom Holland and I had a couple of moments where we came together and I could just tell how wonderful he was and what a beautiful instrument he had. It was just easy to work with him, that was one of the greatest highlights for me: discovering a friendship with Tom off-screen and this beautiful relationship between mother and son on-screen. The intimacy that develops through the course of the film between Lucas and Maria, I just loved that relationship. I mean, Tom is a beyond gifted actor. He\'s just a raw, open talent that is just so easy to work with. And Tom, he\'s inspiring, he kind of lifts everyone\'s game around him because he can do nothing but tell the truth. He was great.\"  In his turn, Tom Holland has returned favours to Naomi Watts when he was asked to present Desert Palm Achievement Award to her at Palm Springs International Film Festival. According to HitFix: \"One recurring theme of the night was how the introductions were often better than actual winner\'s speeches... The best intro, however, had to go to 16-year-old Tom Holland who intro\'d his \"Impossible\" co-star Watts. Holland admitted of all of Watts\' great performances his dad had only let him see \"King Kong\" and while they spent six weeks shooting in a water tank he didn\'t know it was \"difficult\" because he actually \"loved it\"... Most important, this was Holland\'s first film role and he sweetly noted, \"From the moment I met you, you took my hand and you never let go.\" Cue the \"awwww\" from the audience.\" The presentation is available on video.  In 2011, Holland was cast in British version of the animation film Arrietty, produced by Japan\'s cult Studio Ghibli. He has provided voice over for the principal character Sho.

Area Film Critics Association Awards 2012 in the \"Best Youth Performance\" category; for the London Film Critics Circle Awards 2012 in the \"Young British Performer of the Year\" category.  Kristopher Tapley, Editor-at-Large of HitFix, reported on 27 August 2012 that Summit Entertainment, the company responsible for distribution of The Impossible in USA, would be campaigning Holland rather than McGregor as the lead, and strongly argued that Tom Holland deserved to be nominated for an Academy Award in the Best Actor category. The fact of long-listing for an Academy Award was confirmed in the article in the Hollywood Reporter: \"And though McGregor stars as his father in the film, Holland has been submitted as the lead actor for awards consideration. Regardless if he receives any nominations, his performance as the strong-willed and determined eldest son is garnering critical acclaim.\"  As one of the most promising young actors, Holland was featured in Screen International\'s \"UK Stars of Tomorrow - 2012\" and in Variety\'s \"Youth Impact Report 2012\".

After having appeared in films as a child actor in the 1980s, Roshan made his film debut in a leading role in Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai (2000) for which he earned Filmfare Awards for Best Actor and Best Male Debut. It was not just a new actor on the block, but a star was born. He became a romantic hero, an action hero and revolutionized the Hindi film industry in significant ways. Never before had any debutant become an overnight sensation of this kind.  After his debut film, he appeared in Karan Johar\'s family drama Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham (2001), which received immense love not just in India but even overseas.  In 2003, Hrithik Roshan, who is often described as \"India\'s Most Complete Actor\" stunned everyone and proved once again that it is not just the uber-flattering looks that he brings to the table. This was when he flawlessly essayed the role of an intellectually disabled boy in Koi... Mil Gaya. Not only did the film set the cash registers ringing massively, but Roshan also bagged multiple awards for his acting prowess in the film, including the Filmfare Best Actor award.  The makers turned it into a franchise because of the huge commercial success and love that the film received. The next installment, Krrish (2006) saw Hrithik Roshan playing a superhero, which went on to become the first ever-successful Indian superhero in Indian cinema.  Roshan received his 3rd Filmfare Award for Best Actor in 2006 for his performance as an enigmatic master thief in the action film Dhoom 2, with which he redefined style and action and set new bars. He established himself as a major action star. He took stylized action to a whole new level with Bang Bang in 2014, which did massive business at the box office.  In 2012, he created history in Indian cinema when his film, Agneepath minted a whopping 25 crs only on its opening day. That is the star power and pull of Hrithik Roshan.  We also saw him portray the role of the Moghul emperor, Akbar the Great himself in Jodhaa Akbar (2008) for which he received immense critical acclaim and also an International award at a Film festival.  In 2011, Roshan was seen in Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, which became an absolute cult classic.  Before becoming an actor, Hrithik toiled as a largely uncredited assistant on film projects, gradually progressing from unglamorous tasks such as set-sweeping, tea-fetching, or clapper-loading up to a major role in story development, camera, direction, and editing.  Since his entry into the industry, Hrithik has parlayed the natural gift of symmetrical features and a tall athletic frame into unimaginable standards. Through unparalleled work ethic, sheer honesty, talent, and commitment as an actor, he also effectively redefined the Hindi film hero. Actors would now have to act and dance and fight for themselves like never before.  With the kind of roles Hrithik has played on screen, there is no doubt about his acting prowess and versatility. From playing a intellectually disabled boy in Koi... Mil Gaya (2003) to an emperor in Jodhaa Akbar (2008); from playing a quadriplegic in Guzaarish (2010) to a visually impaired man in his more recent film, Kaabil (2017), he has played diverse characters effortlessly with his sheer talent.  Hrithik, a hot favorite for award show performances because of his smooth dance moves, high energy, and immense charm has won 66 awards out of 84 nominations, having a win rate of an outstanding 79%. Hrithik has also won many Style and Glamour awards for his appearances and red carpet outings. He was in fact voted as the \'Most Handsome Actor in the World\' in 2018 by worldstopmost.com  Hrithik married his childhood sweetheart and longtime girlfriend, successful interior designer and businesswoman Sussanne Khan in December 2000. They have two sons: Hrehaan, born in 2006, and Hridaan, born in 2008. While the two got divorced in 2014, they chose to maintain cordial relations with each other for their kids and even today are good friends. - IMDb Mini Biography By: VM  Often described as India\'s \'most complete actor\', Hrithik Roshan is the culmination of old Hindi film industry from both sides of his pedigree.  His maternal grandfather - director-producer _J. Om Prakash_ - first introduced little Hrithik onscreen at age 6 by slyly having his crew shoot without the boy\'s knowledge as he danced on the set of Aasha (1980) while visiting grandpa. J. Om Prakash later gave young Hrithik his only actual speaking role as a child, directing him in the key role of Rajnikanth\'s adopted son in Bhagwaan Dada (1986).  Paternal grandfather Roshan Lal Nagrath - the original \"Roshan\" - was a gifted classical musician and famous composer who as music director in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s helped define the emerging Bollywood film song. He died before Hrithik was born. But even Hrithik\'s grandmother - variously credited as \"Ira Nagrath\" and \"Ira Roshan\" - is herself a musician-composer who completed her husband\'s films at Roshan\'s death and continued for many years as assistant music director on her son\'s projects - Hrithik\'s uncle, multiple Filmfare Award winning composer Rajesh Roshan.  Hrithik\'s father - Rakesh Roshan - entered the film industry as an assistant to J. Om Prakash before shifting to actor, a successful leading man in such films as Khubsoorat (1980). Rakesh later organised the family film company, FilmKraft Productions (India) Pvt. Ltd., first as producer and later director.  Meanwhile Hrithik graduated from Mumbai\'s prestigious Bombay Scottish School and took a Bachelor of Commerce degree first class from Sydenham College. He turned down a UCLA master\'s degree scholarship to enter films. To learn the craft of film from the ground up, from Khel (1992) through Koyla (1997) Hrithik toiled as a largely uncredited assistant on the family\'s film projects, gradually progressing from such unglamorous tasks as set-sweeping, tea-fetching, or clapper-loading up to a major role in story development, camera, direction, and editing. All the while Hrithik studied acting, dance, martial arts, and even bodybuilding (having always been hopelessly thin) to prepare himself to become a film actor.  14 January 2000: Hrithik Roshan\'s resultant debut film, Kaho Naa ... Pyaar Hai, not only firmly established Hrithik as dramatic hero, romantic hero, and action hero, but actually revolutionised the Hindi film industry in significant ways.  Through unparalleled work ethic and sheer honesty, talent, and commitment as an actor, Hrithik has parlayed the natural gift of symmetrical features and a tall athletic frame into hitherto unimaginable standards. He effectively redefined the Hindi film hero. Short, fat, ugly guys no longer need apply. Likewise, actors with limited dramatic range, or those lacking commitment to work. Lead actors would now have to act and dance and fight for themselves as never before. Existing stars either adapted to the new standard, as Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan did, or went into decline, such as Govinda.  In the years since Kaho Naa ... Pyaar Hai Hrithik has never looked back, always continually pushing himself in new directions. Thus he has achieved critical, commercial, and award-winning success with roles as diverse as a charming but brain-damaged child-adult, Koi ... Mil Gaya (2003), an enigmatic master thief, Dhoom 2 (2006), a quadriplegic, Guzaarish (2010), India\'s first film superhero, Krrish (2006), and even the moghul emperor Akbar the Great himself, Jodhaa Akbar (2008).  Hrithik married his childhood sweetheart and longtime girlfriend, successful interior designer and businesswoman Sussanne Khan (herself from a Hindi film clan), in December 2000. They have two sons: Hrehaan, born 2006, and Hridaan, born 2008.'),

After graduating from high school she moved to Los Angeles, California, to pursue acting.  Her career was launched in 2003 when she was cast in the leading role of Hanna Thompson in the low-budget award-winning film The Other Side (2006).

Her second role was in 2004 in Squirrel Trap (2004), in which she played the co-lead role of Sara. A year later she was cast as Jessi XX on the ABC Family series Kyle XY (2006), in which she played the role of a superhuman being created by scientists as a laboratory experiment.

As a child, he dreamed to become an actor, but he also thought that dream was impossible. So he pursued his other love, art, and went to art school instead. He was an interior designer with an architectural firm in London when he at 25 decided to try out acting. Eventually he attended Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, graduating at the age of 29. At the beginning of 90s, he began his career on films.

She grew up on the wrong side of the tracks. Her father, a sculptor and mechanic, left the family when Rene was just two, and thus her mother raised Rene and her sister, Toni, as a single mom. Her father was of Italian descent, and her mother was of Italian and German-English-Irish ancestry.  In junior high school, Rene was plagued with scoliosis and had to wear a full-torso brace. She was already a tall girl, which earned her the nickname \"Jolly Green Giant\" from her classmates. She entered Burroughs High School, along with classmate Ron Howard, and even though her brace had been removed, she was still somewhat of a loner. Unable to deal with academics and the school social scene, Rene dropped out of school in the tenth grade. Since money was tight, she began to take a variety of part-time jobs over the next 18 months, many for the free benefits. She sold refreshments at a movie theater, where she could see free movies; worked as a restaurant hostess, where her meals were free; and worked as a store cashier at Disneyland, where she had free admission. She often had two jobs at one time. Her last job, which was solely for the paycheck, was a full-time job at an eyeglass factory, inspecting contact lenses.  In 1972, the 17-year-old was attending a Rolling Stones concert when she was approached by John Crosby, a scout and manager from International Creative Management. He told her she should be a model and had test photos made of her. Within a few months, Rene signed a contract with Ford Modeling Agency and within a year had become a successful print and photographers model. Soon her modeling breakthrough came when she graced the cover of Vogue. By 1975, she had appeared on numerous magazine covers, was one of the most successful models in America, and was also starting to be seen in several TV commercials through the 1980s. She would define what a top fashion model was for years to come.  By her 30th birthday, demand for her began to dwindle, as it did for most models at that age. She did a few more commercials and then turned her back on modeling and show business for a while. Financially secure for the next several years, she began an intense period of literature and Christian theology. She also began to study theater and acting, and began appearing in theater roles at small regional theaters in Los Angeles and elsewhere in California.  Her television series debut came in 1987 with a supporting part on the short-lived TV series Sable (1987). In 1989 she made her motion picture debut with the part of the lead characters girlfriend in the film Major League (1989). Her subsequent roles were that of girlfriends and supportive wives in a few films, until her breakthrough as an Internal Affairs detective in Lethal Weapon 3 (1992). Rene Russo has been praised for her ability to hold her own against her major male co-stars, who have included Mel Gibson, Clint Eastwood, Kevin Costner and Pierce Brosnan. Two of her performances within the last few years have gotten her recognition as both a major dramatic actress and a talented character actress. One was as the mother of a kidnapped son in Ransom (1996). The other was as the cartoon femme fatale foreign spy in The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle (2000). Although the latter received mixed reviews among moviegoers and critics, Russo was praised for her performance of a role originally slated for Meryl Streep in 1992.

(64, 'Michael Douglas', '1944-10-25', 'New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA', 'michaelDouglas.jpg', 'Quirky, inventive and handsome American actor Michael Keaton first achieved major fame with his door-busting performance as fast-talking ideas man Bill Blazejowski, alongside a nerdish morgue attendant (Henry Winkler), in Night Shift (1982). He played further comedic roles in Mr. Mum (1983), Johnny Dangerously (1984), and Beetlejuice (1988), earned further acclaim for his dramatic portrayal of Bruce Wayne / Batman in Tim Burton\'s Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992), and since then, has moved easily between film genres, ranging from drama and romantic comedy to thriller and action.  Keaton was born Michael John Douglas on September 5, 1951 in Coraopolis, Pennsylvania, to Leona Elizabeth (Loftus), a homemaker, and George A. Douglas, a civil engineer and surveyor. He is of Irish, as well as English, Scottish, and German, descent. Michael studied speech for two years at Kent State, before dropping out and moving to Pittsburgh. An unsuccessful attempt at stand-up comedy led Keaton to working as a TV cameraman in a cable station, and he came to realize he wanted to work in front of the cameras. Keaton first appeared on TV in several episodes of Mister Rogers\' Neighborhood (1968).  He left Pittsburgh and moved to Los Angeles to begin auditioning for TV. He began cropping up in popular TV shows including Maude (1972) and The Mary Tyler Moore Hour (1979). Around this time, Keaton decided to use an alternative surname to remove confusion with better-known actor Michael Douglas. After reading an article on actress Diane Keaton, he decided that Michael Keaton sounded good. His next break was scoring a co-starring role alongside Jim Belushi in the short-lived comedy series Working Stiffs (1979), which showcased his comedic talent and led to his co-starring role in Night Shift (1982). Keaton next scored the lead in the comedy hits Mr. Mum (1983), Johnny Dangerously (1984) , Gung Ho (1986), the Tim Burton horror-comedy Beetlejuice (1988), and The Dream Team (1989).  Keaton\'s career was given another major boost when he was again cast by Tim Burton, this time as the title comic book superhero, millionaire playboy / crime-fighter Bruce Wayne, in Batman (1989). Burton cast him because he thought that Keaton was the only actor who could portray someone who has the kind of darkly obsessive personality that the character demands. To say there were howls of protest by fans of the caped crusader comic strip is an understatement! Warner Bros. was deluged with thousands of letters of complaint commenting that comedian Keaton was the wrong choice for the Caped Crusader, given his prior work and the fact that he lacked the suave, handsome features and tall, muscular physicality often attributed to the character in the comic books. However, their fears were proven wrong when Keaton turned in a sensational performance, and he held his own on screen with opponent Jack Nicholson, playing the lunatic villain, \"The Joker\". Keaton\'s dramatic work earned widespread acclaim from critics and audiences alike, and Batman (1989) became one of the most successful films of the year.  Keaton remained active during the 1990s, appearing in a wide range of films. Keen to diversify his work, Keaton starred as a psychotic tenant in Pacific Heights (1990), as a hard-working cop in One Good Cop (1991), and then donned the black cape and cowl once more for Batman Returns (1992). He remained in demand during the 1990s, appearing in a wide range of films, including the star-studded Shakespearian Much Ado About Nothing (1993), the drama My Life (1993), another Ron Howard comedy The Paper (1994), with sexy Andie MacDowell in Multiplicity (1996), twice in the same role, dogged Elmore Leonard character Agent Ray Nicolette, in Jackie Brown (1997) and Out of Sight (1998). He also played a killer in the mediocre thriller Desperate Measures (1998).  In the 2000s, Keaton appeared in several productions with mixed success, including Live from Baghdad (2002), First Daughter (2004), and Herbie Fully Loaded (2005). He also provided voices for characters in the animated films Cars (2006), Toy Story 3 (2010), and Minions (2015).  He returned to major film roles in the 2010s, co-starring in The Other Guys (2010), RoboCop (2014) and Need for Speed (2014). Also that year, Keaton starred alongside Zach Galifianakis, Edward Norton, Emma Stone, and Naomi Watts in Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) (2014), a film by 21 Grams (2003) and Biutiful (2010) director Alejandro G. Iñárritu. In the film, Keaton plays Riggan Thomson, a screen actor, famous for playing the iconic titular superhero, who puts on a Broadway play based on a Raymond Carver short story, to regain his former glory. Keaton\'s critically praised lead performance earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy, the Critics\' Choice Award for Best Actor and Best Actor in a Comedy, and nominations for the Screen Actors Guild Award, British Academy Film Award, and Academy Award for Best Actor.

(67, 'Bobby Cannavale', '1970-05-03', ' Union City, New Jersey, USA', 'bobbyCannavale.jpg', 'In both career and in real life, Bobby Cannavale tends to choose the unconventional way of doing things. In the beginning, his decisions may have cost the dark, swarthily good-looking actor some acting roles and/or good-paying money but, in the end, his strong work ethic and sense of self, despite a lack of formal training, allowed him to take a successful path off the crowded acting trail. From character goofball and cut-up, he has broken into the leading man ranks with his recent starring role as a reincarnated matchmaker in the TV series Cupid (2009).  Born Roberto M. Cannavale in Union City, New Jersey, to an Italian-American father, Sal, and a Cuban mother, Isabel, he was involved in various activities at his Union City Catholic school, St. Michaels, while growing up. An altar boy, choir boy and lector, he also appeared in the church school\'s various musicals including his very first, \"Guys and Dolls\", in which he showed up as one of the gangsters, and \"The Music Man\", appearing as the lisping, scene-stealing tyke, \"Winthrop\".  Bobby\'s parents divorced when he was five years old and his mother moved the family to Puerto Rico for a couple of years. Eventually, they returned to the States and settled in Coconut Creek, Florida, where he attended high school. Restless and uncomfortable in any sort of regimented setting, he often got suspended for playing the class clown. Graduating in the late 1980s, and bitten by the acting bug, Bobby chose to return to the New York/New Jersey area in order to jump start an acting career. Working in bars to support himself, he again avoided the confines of an acting school and, instead, gained experience as a \"reader\" on occasion with the Naked Angels theatre company. During this time (1994), he met and married Jenny Lumet, the actress-daughter of director Sidney Lumet. They had son, Jake, the following year. The couple divorced in 2003.  Spotted by playwright Lanford Wilson while performing in an East Village production of Larry Kramer\'s \"The Normal Heart\", Bobby was invited to join Wilson\'s prestigious Circle Repertory Theatre. As a \"reader\" for the company, he eventually earned stage parts in \"Chilean Holidays\" (1996) and in Wilson\'s \"Virgil Is Still the Frog Boy.\" He also went on to serve as understudy to Mark Linn-Baker in a 1998 production of \"A Flea in Her Ear\" and later replaced him. A noticeable role in the company\'s play, \"The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told\" by Paul Rudnick led to Bobby\'s being cast in the recurring role of a tugboat operator in the TV series Trinity (1998). Having only appeared in bit parts thus far in such movies as Night Falls on Manhattan (1996), directed by Lumet, and I\'m Not Rappaport (1996), it was \"Trinity\" creator John Wells who caught Bobby\'s stage performance and handed him this career-making break on camera.  Bobby\'s \"nice-guy\" aura and blue-collar charm proved invaluable, if a bit restrictive. Once the \"Trinity\" series ended, Wells cast the 6\'3\" lug with the trademark caterpillar brows and crooked smile as lovelorn paramedic \"Bobby Caffey\" in his series Third Watch (1999). The character became quite popular but Bobby, again feeling restricted and wishing to broaden his horizon as an actor, asked to be released from the show -- but \"in a big way\". Creator Wells obliged and had the paramedic fatally shot in the chest and then experience a \"beyond the grave\" union with his character\'s deceased, ne\'er-do-well dad.  Bobby next joined the cast of father-in-law Sidney Lumet\'s acclaimed TV courtroom drama 100 Centre Street (2001), starring Alan Arkin, cast against type as a brazenly opportunistic prosecutor. He subsequently earned recurring roles on Ally McBeal (1997) (in 2002) and Six Feet Under (2001) (in 2004). As for films, Bobby was featured in Gloria (1999), The Bone Collector (1999), Washington Heights (2002) and The Guru (2002) by the time he scored as the gregarious truck driver in the critically-hailed indie film The Station Agent (2003), which paired him intriguingly opposite the diminutive actor Peter Dinklage.  Unwilling to shirk away from more controversial roles such as his gay drug dealer who has the hots for a fellow prisoner in the acclaimed series Oz (1997) or his closeted dancing neophyte in the film comedy Shall We Dance (2004) starring Richard Gere, Bobby continued to elevate his status seesawing between film (Shortcut to Happiness (2003), Happy Endings (2005), Romance & Cigarettes (2005)) and TV assignments (the miniseries Kingpin (2003)). He earned big viewer points with his recurring portrayal of \"Will Truman\"\'s dour cop/boyfriend on the hit sitcom Will & Grace (1998) in 2004 and won a \"Guest Star\" Emmy award in the process. Elsewhere, on stage, he merited attention in such productions as \"Hurlyburly\" and earned a Tony Award nomination for his 2007 Broadway debut in \"Mauritius\".  After five consecutive failed pilots, Bobby has come front-and-center with his quirky starring role in the ABC series Cupid (2009), recurring roles in Cold Case (2003) and Nurse Jackie (2009), and topnotch Emmy-winning part in Boardwalk Empire (2010). He also continues to rake up credits on the big screen (The Merry Gentleman (2008), Diminished Capacity (2008), The Take (2007), 100 Feet (2008), Roadie (2011)).

The film revolves around a motley group of friends who band together to make an amateur porn film. Greer plays a young temptress at the local mattress store who secures a role in the movie by allowing the store to be used as a film location.  Greer wrapped production in New York on a co-starring role opposite Tom McCarthy (\"The Station Agent\") in Danny Leiner\'s The Great New Wonderful (2005) for Serenade Films/Sly Dog Films. The dark comedy tells five different stories against the backdrop of an uncertain post-September 11 New York. The cast also includes Maggie Gyllenhaal, Edie Falco and Tony Shalhoub.  She also appeared in writer-director Adam Goldberg\'s psychological drama I Love Your Work (2003), opposite Giovanni Ribisi. The film is about a fictional movie star (Ribisi) and his gradual meltdown and increasing obsession with a young film student and his girlfriend. The stellar cast also included Franka Potente, Christina Ricci, and Jason Lee and debuted at the 2003 Toronto International Film Festival. In the film, Greer plays Samantha, the personal assistant of Ribisi\'s character.  Greer had a starring role as the female lead role in the comedy The Hebrew Hammer (2003) as the feisty, fearless Esther, who joins forces with an Orthodox Jewish Blaxploitation hero (Adam Goldberg) to save Hanukkah from an evil son of Santa Claus (Andy Dick). The Hebrew Hammer (2003) debuted at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival and premiered on Comedy Central followed by a theatrical release.  She also appeared in Adaptation. (2002), from director Spike Jonze. In the film, Nicolas Cage stars as self-loathing writer Charlie Kaufman (and twin brother Donald) as he attempts to adapt the novel \"The Orchid Thief\" for the big screen. Greer played Alice, the waitress with whom he becomes obsessed -- the object of his fantasies.  Greer turned in a scene-stealing comedic performance in The Wedding Planner (2001), with Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey, in which she played Penny, Lopez\'s sweet but ditsy assistant who tries hard, but often falls a little short. Equally adept at more dramatic roles, Greer gave a standout performance opposite Mel Gibson in What Women Want (2000), playing a suicidal file clerk rescued by the one man who can hear women\'s thoughts. Greer\'s pivotal scene with Gibson is the heart of the film.  With a genuine gift for comedy and an engaging on-screen presence, Judy Greer has quickly become one of Hollywood\'s most captivating talents. Having appeared in such diverse films as Jawbreaker (1999), What Women Want (2000), The Wedding Planner (2001), Adaptation. (2002), and Wilson (2017) as well as a number of upcoming feature film projects, Greer turns in scene-stealing performances opposite some of the industry\'s biggest stars.'),

He made a name for himself with Hated: GG Allin & the Murder Junkies (1993) and latched on to the controversy surrounding the documentary ChickenHawk (1994).\r\nHas cast Matt Walsh in most of his movies.\r\nFrequently uses the music of Bill Withers and Wolfmother in his movies.\r\nBorn on the same date as Nicole de Boer.\r\nHis father Peter was born in Blaby, Leicestershire, England, to Jewish emigrant parents, Norbert E. Bunzl, who was born in Prague, and Anna (Fuchs), who was born in Zboriv, Ukraine.<br>,br>\r\nIt\'s been said comedy is not action, it\'s reaction, and Ed is the KIng of Reaction. Ed, when he wakes up and sees his tattoo on his face or his tooth is missing, or at the end of the movie - no one does reaction better than Ed. He\'s the unsung hero of these movies.\r\nThe worst thing you can do as a comedy director is be on set and think of something ridiculous, or an actor comes up to you with something ridiculous, and you say \'No, no that\'s too much.\' Let\'s not worry if that\'s too much, let\'s shoot it, and then decide if that\'s too much when we see it.\r\nYou know, if I started worrying about what the critics think, I\'d never make another comedy. You couldn\'t pick a less funny group than critics - you couldn\'t find a more bitter group of people!\r\nTo be honest with you, since \'Ocean\'s 11,\' \'The Hangover\' has become a movie that defines Vegas. Anybody in Vegas will tell you that and I\'m proud of it. I love that. I think \'Hangover\' does Vegas right and I think that not only, as you said, it\'s the top-grossing R-rated comedy of all-time, it\'s also the top-grossing about Vegas or set in Vegas.\r\nThere\'s a punk-rock attitude, clearly, to \'Hated.\' There\'s even a punk-rock attitude to \'The Hangover,\' I think. We start the movie with a Glenn Danzig song.\r\nI got nominated for an Academy Award(R) for writing \'Borat.\'\r\nBangkok, like Las Vegas, sounds like a place where you make bad decisions.\r\nDirectors tend to be more underrated than overrated because it\'s a quiet job and people don\'t really understand it.\r\nThere\'s a darkness under \'The Hangover\' because ultimately there\'s a missing person and it\'s not really that funny. There\'s a sort of darkness under it that I love, and still people are laughing as hard if not harder than they did in \'Old School.\'\r\nIt\'s all about escapism. That\'s essentially what all movies are about. It\'s a vicarious thrill.\r\nI really got into filmmaking through photography.\r\nI find I like to work with a lot of the same actors, because I find that there\'s sort of shorthand there, and there is this unspoken trust, both ways. They trust me and I trust them. And I know what I\'m going to get from them, to an extent. It\'s just fun, kind of creating this little family.\r\nIt\'s heartbreaking when you hear a kid buying a ticket for... I don\'t know, whatever movie you\'re up against. And you see them sneaking into your film. It\'s just heartbreaking. But in the spirit of full disclosure, that is what I did as an 11-year-old sneaking into \'Stripes.\'\r\nComedy is so subjective. You could be in a room with 400 people laughing at a joke and you could just not think it\'s funny. You\'re just sitting there like, \'Am I in the twilight zone? Why is everyone laughing?\' It\'s such a personal thing. People have such a personal visceral response to comedy.\r\nReality television hasn\'t killed documentaries, because there are so many great documentaries still being made, but it certainly has changed the landscape. There is this breed of gimmicky documentary that is basically a reality show.\r\nMy dog\'s a gentleman.\r\nI was taught that you didn\'t want to be part of the group - that it was better to do your own thing.\r\nI don\'t have a horror film in me just because I don\'t like to be scared. But I definitely have a documentary in me, and I certainly have dramas.\r\nAll my movies, as I get the ability to do it, they tend to go a little darker, a little darker.\r\nI just love the look of film. But I have nothing against HD.\r\nI think people like comedies and I think concept driven comedies seem to be working when it\'s a clear concept and you deliver funny stuff.\r\nI never had a ton of male friends and it\'s always been something that\'s really interesting to me, what brings guys together? The bonding. \'Old School\' is a good example of that. And even \'Starsky\' and even \'Road Trip.\'\r\n\'The Hangover\' was lightening in a bottle. We\'re aware of that. It went through the roof all over the world.\r\nI think that \'Hangover II\' is as funny as \'The Hangover I,\' honest to God, but I think that it\'s a little bit darker, and the stakes are a little bit higher.\r\nComedies are just never that expensive quite frankly. They really aren\'t. We aren\'t doing green screen shooting, so even Hangover II in Bangkok might seem like it\'s expensive, you\'re flying over and back, but they\'re just not that expensive to make when you do it the way we do it which is very focused and I\'ve done it before.\r\nI\'d love to do a movie with females in it, and not necessarily the female version of \'The Hangover,\' but I\'d love to. If I did it it\'d star Juliette Lewis, because she\'s the funniest woman in the world. She\'s my favorite actress on the planet. If we did a character-based comedy about women, I don\'t see it out of my range.\r\nI think any filmmaker looks back and thinks, \'Boy, if we only had four hours more on that day when the sun was going down,\' or, \'If we only spent more time and went back.\'\r\nI\'m not a huge fan of 3-D, though. Honestly, I think that movies are an immersive experience and an audience experience. There\'s nothing like seeing a film with 500 people in a theater. And there\'s something about putting on 3-D glasses that makes it a very singular experience for me. Suddenly I\'m not connected to the audience anymore.\r\nThere are movie sites that love movies and there are movie sites that are just bitter people that just hate movies. I find Movieline to be in the latter. The tone is bizarrely hateful.\r\nI\'m first and foremost a company man, surprising as that is. I love Warner Brothers. That\'s where I have a deal. That\'s where I\'ve been for years. So I don\'t really interact too much with other studios and do things with other studios and I don\'t necessarily read scripts from other studios.\r\nI think comedy directors tend to feel a need to justify the bad behavior, and I just never think that. I like bad behavior, I\'ve always liked bad behavior, I\'m a fan of bad behavior, and I don\'t think you have to justify bad behavior.\r\nJohn Goodman\'s pretty dark - I love John Goodman.\r\nYou set the tone on the set that you want to see in the film.\r\nWhen I was younger I was obsessed with \'Star 80,\' and it\'s just a great movie - I think I saw it three times in the theater.\r\nNot every movie has to serve as every audience member\'s need for completion.\r\nI like - there\'s a better word for it, but I like the danger that a comic brings to a role. It has a feeling, even though everything\'s scripted and everything\'s planned what you\'re going to do. When I see Will Ferrell or Sacha Baron Cohen, there\'s a feeling that anything could happen.\r\nWhen I was younger I didn\'t really know what a director did: I knew I loved movies and I figured the actors made it up! And then when you get to 12 years old you start thinking, What does a director do? It was really an organic beginning: this looks like something I want to do, I can\'t believe people get paid to do it!\r\nWith comedy especially, it feels like such a clear-cut thing to be a writer-director. There is so much nuance and tone in a comedy that it\'s hard to contextualise it in a script.\r\nWhen I\'m writing, I\'m writing for a particular actor. When a lot of writers are writing, they\'re writing an idea. So they\'re not really writing in a specific voice.\r\nWell, it\'s so cheesy to say but you can\'t find a comedy director who makes movies for critics. When a movie does $580 million worldwide, I\'m not saying that proves anything except people were enjoying the experience.\r\nI remember that when I got to NYU, everyone was writing scripts. But I was 18 at the time, and when you write a script, so much of it is about what you pull from life, and this sounds sort of cheesy, but I felt like I didn\'t have enough life experience at that point to write a movie.\r\nI tend to make movies about my peer group. I couldn\'t see myself now going back and making a movie about a bunch of college kids, necessarily. I kind of always operate in the things I\'m observing around me, whether it\'s friends having babies now in my life or what have you.\r\nI take it very seriously, music. I think it\'s one of the tools that a director has with which to kind of paint. The right music can sometimes do five pages of scripted dialogue.\r\nI think reviewers have become particularly venomous because, in a way, the power has been sucked from them. A 15-year-old can write a review on the Internet and it means as much as Roger Ebert\'s review, and that just makes Roger Ebert mad, so he comes out harder and stronger.\r\nYou\'re only as good as your body of work, and everybody has issues, whether it\'s Steven Spielberg or Martin Scorsese. I\'m not comparing myself to those guys, but you learn more from the misses than the hits.'),
(72, 'Joaquin Phoenix', '1974-10-28', ' San Juan, Puerto Rico', 'joaquinPhoenix.jpg', 'Joaquin Phoenix was born Joaquin Rafael Bottom in San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Arlyn (Dunetz) and John Bottom, and is the middle child in a brood of five. His parents, from the continental United States, were then serving as Children of God missionaries. His mother is from a Jewish family from New York, while his father, from California, is of mostly British Isles descent. As a youngster, Joaquin took his cues from older siblings River Phoenix and Rain Phoenix, changing his name to Leaf to match their earthier monikers. When the children were encouraged to develop their creative instincts, he followed their lead into acting. Younger sisters Liberty Phoenix and Summer Phoenix rounded out the talented troupe.\r\n\r\nThe family moved often, traveling through Central and South America (and adopting the surname \"Phoenix\" to celebrate their new beginnings) but, by the time Joaquin was age 6, they had more or less settled in the Los Angeles area. Arlyn found work as a secretary at NBC, and John turned his talents to landscaping. They eventually found an agent who was willing to represent all five children, and the younger generation dove into television work. Commercials for meat, milk, and junk food were off-limits (the kids were all raised as strict vegans), but they managed to find plenty of work pushing other, less sinister products. Joaquin\'s first real acting gig was a guest appearance on River\'s sitcom, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1982).\r\n\r\nHe worked with his brother again on the afterschool special ABC Afterschool Specials: Backwards: The Riddle of Dyslexia (1984), then struck out on his own in other made-for-TV productions. He made his big-screen debut as the youngest crew member in the interstellar romp SpaceCamp (1986), then won his first starring turn in the Cold War-era drama Russkies (1987). In the late \'80s, the Phoenix clan decided to pull up stakes and relocate again--this time to Florida. River\'s film career had enough momentum to sustain the move, but Joaquin wasn\'t sure what lay in store for him in the Sunshine State. As it happened, Universal Pictures had just opened a new studio in the area and he was cast almost immediately as an angst-ridden adolescent in Parenthood (1989). His performance was very well-received, but Joaquin decided to withdraw from acting for a while--he was frustrated with the dearth of interesting roles for actors his age, and he wanted to see more of the world.\r\n\r\nHis parents were in the process of separating, so he struck out for Mexico with his father. Joaquin returned to the public eye three years later under tragic circumstances. On October 31, 1993, he was at The Viper Room (a Los Angeles nightclub partly-owned by Johnny Depp) when his brother River collapsed from a drug overdose and later died. Joaquin made the call to 911, which was rebroadcast on radio and television the world over. Months later, at the insistence of friends and colleagues, Joaquin began reading through scripts again, but he was reluctant to re-enter the acting life until he found just the right part. He finally signed up to work with Gus Van Sant (who had directed River in My Own Private Idaho (1991) and Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (1993)) to star as Nicole Kidman\'s obsessive devotee in To Die For (1995). The performance made Joaquin (who had dropped Leaf and reverted to his birth name) a critics\' darling in his own right.\r\n\r\nHis follow-up turn in Inventing the Abbotts (1997) scored more critical kudos and, perhaps more importantly, introduced him to his one-time fiancée Liv Tyler. (The pair dated for almost three years.) He returned to the big screen later that year with a supporting role in Oliver Stone\'s U Turn (1997), then played a locked-up drug scapegoat in Return to Paradise (1998). He and \"Paradise\" co-star Vince Vaughn re-teamed almost immediately for the small-town murder caper Clay Pigeons (1998), which Joaquin followed with a turn as a porn store clerk in 8MM (1999). The film that confirmed Phoenix as a star was the historical epic Gladiator (2000). The Roman epic cast him as the selfish, paranoid young emperor Commodus opposite Russell Crowe\'s swarthy hero. Determined to make his character as real as possible, Phoenix gained weight and cultivated a pasty complexion during the shoot. He received international attention and an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for that role.\r\n\r\nLater that year, he appeared in two indies, playing a dock worker in The Yards (2000) (which he counts among his favorite experiences--and one of the only films of his that he can sit through) and the priest in charge of the Marquis de Sade\'s asylum in Quills (2000).

But they did use one of his other assets, his deep baritone voice, which was used for narration and background commentary. He was successful in being cast in Saat Hindustani. He got his break in Bollywood after a letter of introduction from the then Prime Minister Mrs. Indira Gandhi, as he was a friend of her son, Rajiv Gandhi. This is how Amitabh made an entry in Bollywood, starting with Zanjeer, co-starred with his future wife Jaya Bhaduri, and since then there has been no looking back.\r\n\r\nHe married Jaya Bhaduri, an accomplished actress in her own right, and they had two children, Shweta and Abhishek. Shweta is married, lives a non-filmy life and has two children.\r\n\r\nBeing friends with Rajiv Gandhi, got him to decide to run for seat in the Congress from his hometown but had to leave midterm because of controversies, particularly after Rajiv and he were implicated in the now infamous \"Bofors\" case along with the U.K. based Hinduja Brothers.\r\n\r\nAfter a four year break, he was back in the unsuccessful Mrityudaata (1997), a comeback which the actor wanted to forget. Critics written him off but his career was saved with Bade Miyan Chote Miyan (1998). But four flops in 1999 and incurring debt of over 90 Crores rupees of his sinking company ABCL saw him at an all-time low. To make matters worse, after the defeat of the Congress party, Amitabh lost considerable political support, the opposition made him a target, and his credit rating deteriorated to such an extent that a leading nationalized bank, Canara Bank, sued him for outstanding loans. He did bounce back, presenting the Indian version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire called Kaun Banega Crorepati? (2000). After a series of hits with Mohabbatein (2000), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001) and Baghban (2003) and Khakee (2004), this elderly Bachchan is showing no signs of slowing down and proving the critics wrong once again.\r\n\r\nHis son, Abhishek, is also an actor by his own rights.\r\n\r\nAmitabh and Jaya were interested in getting Abhishek married to Karishma, the daughter of Babita and Randhir Kapoor, they went through a formal engagement, but later broke it off.\r\n\r\nThe former Miss World and Bollywood actress, Aishwarya Rai, and Abhishek, were formally engaged on Sunday January 14, 2007, at the Bachchan residence in Juhu, Bombay, with the marriage taking place at the Bachchan residence on April 20, 2007.\r\n\r\nOn November 16, 2011, he became a Dada (Paternal Grandfather) when Aishwarya gave birth to a daughter in Mumbai Hospital. He is already a Nana (maternal grandfather) to Navya Naveli and Agastye - Shweta\'s children.\r\n\r\nHe continues to be one of the busiest actors and singers in Bollywood as well as on TV, as can be seen from the commercials that he appears on, especially on Sahara One. Looks like there are no limits for this super-star and once the \"Angry Young Man\" of Bollywood.'),

Captain America: Civil War is a descent awesome MCU super action the third film of the Captain America trilogy. To me the second movie Captain America: The Winter Soldier is still the best one I just love that movie to death, but I like this one I love the first one but I just love all three of Captain America films. I thought the cast did a good job Chris Evens kicks ass once again he is Captain America and I look this movie from his point of view. He is really become my favorite hero of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the Avengers films especially Age of Ultron, Captain America is still a guy who has a lot of screen time that it is the focus of a movie and he is still the guy I can take a side I agree with him, I can understand his choices.\r\n\r\nWe have also almost everyone from Avengers films except Thor and Hulk actors Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo did not appear. Chris Hemsworth thought that MCU fired him because he was not cast as Thor but he was later explained that MCU wants his own movie and his own stand alone path which I can\'t wait for Thor: Ragnarok.\r\n\r\nThe cast beside Chris Evens includes Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Emily VanCamp, Tom Holland, Frank Grillo, William Hurt, and Daniel BrÃ¼hl.\r\n\r\nIn Captain America: Civil War, disagreement over international oversight of the Avengers fractures them into opposing factions-one led by Steve Rogers and the other by Tony Stark. We have two opposite teams now fighting each other:\r\n\r\nTeam Iron Man: War Machine, Black Widow, Black Panther, The Vision, Spider-Man.\r\n\r\nTeam Captain America: Hawkeye, Sharon Carter, Falcon, Bucky Barnes, Ant-Man, Scarlet Witch.\r\n\r\nThe battle between Captain America and Iron Man draws a political line in the sand. On one side, you have Tony Stark, a man looking to protect the world from super-powered individuals who\'ve proved in the past to be more destructive than helpful. On the other, you have Steve Rogers championing civil liberties. It\'s the age old debate of safety coming at the cost of freedom, and we\'ll get to see it play out to a hopefully satisfying conclusion this year.\r\n\r\nThe action scenes are fantastic, the fight scenes on the airport are incredible heart pulse breath taking awesome. The fight scenes were very well done and well choreographed. I liked this movie more the story drew me in, the villain wasn\'t that good.\r\n\r\nRobert Downey Jr. does a good job, Paul Rudd he is fun in the flick, he has a great moment as Ant-Man he has a few moments but one predictable. Scarlett Johansson did great! Black Widow kicked ass specially in the beginning of the flick. Anthony Mackie I really like him as Falcon he as a lot of good stuff in this. He was down played in Age of Ultron but has a lot screen time in here which was excellent and they made that for that in this one I am glad for it. Anthony Mackie has a lot of good screen time, specially in the action moments. Falcon has a remote control like a mini Flacon I thought that was really cool. Chris Evens is to root for this character, Black Panther interesting the actor playing black panther was really good I like him and I am really interested seeing his up coming movie. Bucky Barnes: Winter Soldier did fine.\r\n\r\nA lot of people are complain about how terrible this movie is I am sorry I don\'t see it that way, I don\'t see at all it is peace of sh**. I wish that Frank Grillo as Brock Rumlow / Crossbones wouldn\'t die and it was nice to see him in the beginning of the movie. I still wish he would work for the villain I still enjoy his screen time.\r\n\r\nI thought Chris Evens and Robert Downey Jr, did work great as a opposite team.

Enjoyed the movie with all heart :). Good luck and love to team KGF!', '2019-10-14 07:56:15', 10),

Costner plays his usual \"wise teacher\" character, the only character he can play, and you really get a sense of his limited acting abilities here. Kutcher is terrible in the Richard Gere character, just miscast with acting skills barely a notch above Keanu Reeves.The main problem with this OAAG wannabe is the two main characters are so amazingly one-dimensional, you never care for either in the least and when Kutcher\'s character finally turns around (just like Gere did in OAAG) you just go \"so what? The movie leaves no plot point unturned and seems to never end as if to say \"oh wait, we forgot to close out the girlfriend story, or the what happens after he graduates story, or the other six plot points in the movie...\" What\'s more baffling is the great \"reviews\" I see here.

To tell you the truth it was kind of boring to me and at some spots it didn\'t make sense. The only reason I watched this movie in the first place was to see CHACE CRAWFORD!!! He is so hot, but in this movie his hair was kind of weird. But still hot.However, despite how hot CHACE is, it really did not make up for the film. I guess the plot isn\'t that bad but what really threw me over was the fact that they cuss in like every sentence. Is it that hard to express your anger without saying the F word every time?The cussing was annoying and the whole flashy, camera shaking thing gave me a headache.All in all, although the plot was OK, I found the film to be a bore and over dramatic. That\'s why I only cut to scenes with CHACE in it. LOL Anyways, not worth renting unless your a die-hard fan of a specific cast member like I was. Oh yeah the cast was Hot. The girls were HOT!!!
